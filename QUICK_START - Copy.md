## Tips for Best Results

- **Upload PDFs**: For best results, use PDF format for your resume uploads
- **Detailed Job Descriptions**: The more detailed the job description, the better the matching and suggestions
- **Review All Suggestions**: Don't automatically apply all suggestions; review them for relevance
- **Enhanced NLP**: For better resume parsing and job matching, consider installing the enhanced NLP dependencies

## Troubleshooting

- **Slow Performance**: If the application runs slowly, consider using the basic mode without enhanced NLP features
- **Extraction Issues**: If information isn't extracted correctly, try uploading a cleaner PDF version of your resume
- **Template Issues**: If the template doesn't render correctly, try another template or adjust your content
- **Missing Dependencies**: Use the launcher script to install any missing dependencies
